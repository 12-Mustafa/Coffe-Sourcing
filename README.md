Coffee Quality Sourcing
This project leverages the well-known coffee dataset to explore the factors influencing coffee quality across origins, varieties, and processing methods. 
The primary objective was to apply advanced data visualization techniques—such as heatmaps, box plots, pair plots, and interactive charts—to uncover meaningful insights. 
These visualizations help in understanding the distribution of quality scores, correlations among features, 
and patterns across regions, enabling buyers and stakeholders to make informed sourcing decisions in the specialty coffee market.
